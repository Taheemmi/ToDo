Update: The advanced folder is where i am adding password hashing and also tasks which are linked to the user. Currently the version uploaded has user log in and able to hash password to not store them as plain text. But users can see other tasks, currently I am figuring out a solution where the userauthentication, program and task manager are separate to help me learn how to combine files together to make an application.

Update 2: The application works and is fully functional. I will look into making a graphical user interface. 

13/06/2024 - I am currently making a gui based application which is very janky at this moment, just about got it to enter and display tasks but i plan on having the whole application in the advanced folder to have a GUI. However, there is alot to go through and will need changes which requires the project to be done by scratch. I may find a way to glue the gui with my existing functions but I am sure that i will need to do it from the ground up.
