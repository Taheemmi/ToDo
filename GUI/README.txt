For this folder i will use the same code from Advanced but make a graphical user interface for it.


I learnt the hard way i cant just copy and paste my code, it would be easier but its too many errors to go through. I am going to redo the todo so it aligns witht the WPF standard. 

This is a WIP (Work In Progress)
